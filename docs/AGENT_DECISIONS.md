## Decision Log

### 2026-02-23 — /boot: Initial Template Structure Selected

- **Decision**: Use standard AI OS 4-folder structure (`docs/`, `ops/`, `src/`, `data/`, `logs/`, `temp/`).
- **Rationale**: Consistent with GLOBAL AI OS RULES naming conventions and template repo policy.
- **Made by**: Agent 1 (via /boot)
- **Alternatives considered**: None — template defines canonical structure.
